# The HoriSEOn Optimization

## Summary

When I first laid eyes on the the Horiseon code I knew i had some work ahead of me. It was full of failed links and incessant redundancies. Both from the html stand point and css. Not to mention the optimizational mess it had on it's hands; what with all the missing alt tags for images, the gigantic images, and such. However, despite all that, I think you will find a much cleaner, more organized, and better optimized site than described. The Folowing being proof of concept.
